          <p class="lead">In the chat feature, post a link to your portfolio as well as your goal job or position. The Storyteller will be interpreting your portfolio and telling the story of your portfolio so as you’re listening to the story, think about which parts you feel are most relevant. Keep time for the Storyteller as well (2 minutes to scan the portfolio and 5 minutes for the storytelling).</p>

          <h2>The Storyteller</h2>
          <p class="lead">Take 2 minutes to scan the Designer’s portfolio. Then share your screen to show the Designer’s portfolio so that the group can follow along. Based solely on the portfolio without explanation or context, pretend you are the Designer and tell a story about yourself to the Hiring Manager as if you were pitching yourself for the Designer’s goal job. 
            <br><br>
          Keep your story to roughly 5 minutes; it should be a quick elevator pitch rather than a detailed retelling of the portfolio. Don’t spend too much time reading through the portfolio or trying to gain a complete or accurate picture. The point is to try to tell the Designer’s story with the information that you see, and use your own interpretation to try to tell the story!

As you’re listening, think about what stands out to you most about the Designer’s story from a hiring perspective. What do you feel is missing or something you’d like to know more about from the Designer’s story?</p>
